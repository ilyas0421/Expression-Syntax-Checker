<h1 align="center">Expression Syntax Checker 🔍</h1>

<p>
This project is an expression syntax checker that helps users verify the syntax of their mathematical expressions. It was developed using the Tkinter library in Python and has a simple, user-friendly interface.

The program allows users to enter a mathematical expression and checks for any syntax errors, such as unbalanced brackets or invalid characters. If the expression is correctly formatted, a message is displayed indicating that the syntax is correct. If there are any errors, the program highlights the location of the error and suggests a possible solution.

It was developed by two passionate students at CPGE Salmane AL Farissi as a year-end project, showcasing their skills in both Python and data structures.
